Let's solve each part of the problem:

a. **Real Return Calculation:**
The real return is calculated by adjusting the nominal rate of return for inflation. The formula for real return is:

\[ \text{Real Return} = \frac{1 + \text{Nominal Return}}{1 + \text{Inflation Rate}} - 1 \]

Given that the rate of return on 3-month Treasury bills is 4% and the 3-month expected inflation rate is 2%:

\[ \text{Real Return} = \frac{1 + 0.04}{1 + 0.02} - 1 \]
\[ \text{Real Return} = \frac{1.04}{1.02} - 1 \]
\[ \text{Real Return} = \frac{1.0196}{1} - 1 \]
\[ \text{Real Return} \approx 0.0196 \]

So, the real return is approximately \(1.96\%\).

b. **Nominal Rate of Return for Each Security:**
The nominal rate of return is the sum of the real return and the inflation rate. The formula is:

\[ \text{Nominal Return} = \text{Real Return} + \text{Inflation Rate} \]

Now we can calculate the nominal rate of return for each security:

- For Security A:
  \[ \text{Nominal Return (A)} = 0.0196 + 0.06 = 0.0796 \] (or 7.96%)

- Similarly, calculate for Securities B, C, D, and E.

c. **Differences in Inflationary Expectation:**
The inflationary expectation for each security is different because it reflects the market's perception of future inflation for each investment horizon (time to maturity). Investors may have varying expectations based on economic conditions, government policies, and other factors. Shorter-term securities like Security A may have higher expected inflation due to the uncertainty in the near term, while longer-term securities like Security E may have a different expectation.

Please note that these calculations assume that the risk premium is already incorporated into the given nominal return for each security. If not, you would need to add the risk premium to the nominal return to get the total nominal return.
